## Motivation

Consolidate my previous knowledge of SQL, Data Cleaning, and Tableau to extract insights and create info-telling dashboards.


## About the Data

We have five csv files:

* transactions: contains sales quantity and amount for different products in different markets spanned from 2017 to 2020
* customers: contains the names of the stores that buy the hardware
* date: contains date of the transactions
* markets: contains the regions of distribution
* products: contains products code and types.

## Challenges

* Data Cleaning in MySQL 
* ETL in Tableau
